# libsimplify: Mesh Simplification Library

`libsimplify` is a specialized library designed for the simplification of 3D mesh structures. Implemented using C++ and
Cython, it offers an efficient solution for reducing the complexity of 3D meshes while preserving essential geometrical
features.

## Features

- **3D Mesh Simplification**: Provides functionality to simplify 3D meshes composed of triangles and vertices.
- **3D Vector Support**: Utilizes 3D vectors for spatial calculations and transformations.
- **Symmetric Matrix Operations**: Includes symmetric matrix operations, possibly for error calculations in the
  simplification process.
- **Cython Integration**: Offers a seamless interface between C++ and Python, enabling easy integration into Python
  projects.

## Installation

To install `libsimplify`, ensure that Cython is installed on your system. Then, clone the repository and navigate to the
root directory, and run the following commands:

```bash
pip install .
```
