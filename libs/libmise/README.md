# libmise: Multi-Resolution ISO Surface Extraction Library

`libmise` is a powerful library that offers functionality for multi-resolution ISO surface extraction. It's implemented
using C++ and Cython, providing a fast and efficient interface for working with 3D grid structures and volumetric data.

## Features

- **3D Vector Representation**: Utilizes 3D vectors for spatial calculations.
- **Voxel-Based Grids**: Works with voxel structures, allowing for detailed 3D grid representations.
- **Multi-Resolution Support**: Allows for multi-resolution analysis of ISO surfaces.
- **Cython Integration**: Utilizes Cython to achieve high-performance computations, seamlessly bridging C++ and Python.

## Installation

To install `libmise`, you'll need to have Cython installed on your system. Clone the repository and navigate to the root
directory, then run the following commands:

```bash
pip install .
```
