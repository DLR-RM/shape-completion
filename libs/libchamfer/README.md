# Chamfer Distance CUDA Extension

A CUDA extension for computing Chamfer distance using PyTorch. This extension provides a highly efficient implementation
that leverages CUDA for parallel computation.

## Installation

Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install torch
```

Then, you can install the Chamfer package directly from the source code:

```bash
pip install .
```

## Usage

You can use the `chamfer` extension in your PyTorch project as follows:

```python
import chamfer

# Your code to compute Chamfer distance here...
```

## Documentation

Detailed documentation and usage examples can be found [here](link_to_documentation).

## Contributing
